# A high definition psychrometric chart for teachers
A high definition psychrometric chart for teaching humidification operations without the pain. The chart was closely redrawn from a document issued by a French heating company defunct in 1970. The original that I still own (in something close to A1 format) is a real piece of art drawn by hand. It deserved a digitalization, here it is.

I used this precise chart as student in chemical engineering around 1999 and use it for teaching the same since 2007. I never got used to another one as this is by far the most comprehensive version I've ever found, it contains some unusual (and very handy) features:
- The iso-enthalpy lines and the wet bulb temperature are drawn separately, which is very uncommon as both are generally confused;
- A compass to generate the unit operation of air saturation with the minimal quantity of a given water source is given, as it is rather difficult to plot usually (despite being very important to teach as very first example);
- It ranges between -15°C and 50°C, which allows studying problems from snow-blowers to cooling towers for Rankine cycles with a single chart;
- The enthalpy units are in kilocalories per kg on purpose. It allows simplifying a calculation step for cooling towers, because the specific heat capacity of water is by definition 1 kcal/kg.

 I've modified some parts of the original chart:
 - The compass for air saturation with minimal quantity of water is more compact and easier to use as it was initially spread on the whole chart and barely readable as sunk among other informations;
 - It features the slope for finding interface enthalpies for cooling towers operations (which is not exactly vertical);
 - The vapor pressure of water is given in Pa instead of kg per square centimeters;
 - x-axis and y-axis are othogonal now.

The repo contains a high resolution pdf ready to print, the source Powerpoint file that you can modify and the image file I used to digitalize the chart (it's a scan of a bad quality A3 reduction of the original chart but I do not remind where I got it). The PNG file is just a low res preview, do not use it. The chart is meant to be printed in A3 for better reading even if A4 may be OK if you have good eyes. 

Why not using a code for doing this ? Because pen and paper are enough !
