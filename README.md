# High definition psychrometric chart
A high definition psychrometric chart for teaching humidification operations without pain. The chart was freely adapted from a working document of a French company defunct in 1970, so I guess the data are in the public domain now. I used it as student in chemical engineering around 1999 and use it for teaching the same since 2007. This is the most comprenhensive version I've ever found. The repo contains a high resolution pdf and the law res raster source files I used to draw it. The PNG file is just a low res preview, do not use it.

It is meant to be printed in A3 for better reading even if A4 may be OK for students.
